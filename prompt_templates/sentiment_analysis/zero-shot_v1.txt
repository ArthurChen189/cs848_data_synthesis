Generate three realistic financial news headlines for sentiment analysis.

Guidelines for Generating Headlines:

Sentiment Labeling:
Each headline must be assigned a sentiment label based on its tone:
	•	Bearish (0): Indicates negative sentiment about a stock or market trend.
	•	Bullish (1): Indicates positive sentiment about a stock or market trend.
	•	Neutral (2): Indicates neutral or informational tone.

Format:
Your answer should be in JSON format:
{{"headline": "<your headline>", "sentiment": "<your sentiment label, 0, 1, or 2>"}}

Now, generate three new financial news headlines following these guidelines. 
Please use JSON format and generate one type of each sentiment label (0, 1, 2) for diversity.
