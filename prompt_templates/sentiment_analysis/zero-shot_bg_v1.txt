Generate three realistic financial news headlines about stock tickers following real-world financial reporting for sentiment analysis.

Guidelines for Generating Headlines:

1. Format & Style:
	•	Headlines must be concise and mimic real financial news.
	•	Use sentence case formatting (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
	•	Some headlines should start with a stock ticker (e.g., $AAPL -), while others should begin with the company name or a broader market trend.

2. Ticker Inclusion:
	•	At least one headline should include a stock ticker (e.g., $TSLA - or $NVDA -).
	•	Some headlines should refer to companies by name instead of tickers (e.g., “Alphabet and Meta see price targets cut at Barclays”).

3. Common Financial Themes:

Ensure headlines reflect realistic financial news topics, including:
	•	Stock downgrades/upgrades
	•	Price target adjustments
	•	Market trends/economic outlook
	•	Company performance concerns
	•	Company news
	•	Company announcements
	•	Company events

4. Source Attribution:
	•	When relevant, mention an investment firm, analyst, or research group (e.g., Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Oppenheimer).
	•	Do not fabricate research firms—use only well-known institutions.

5. Sentiment Labeling:

Each headline must be assigned a sentiment label based on its tone:
	•	Bearish (0): Indicates negative sentiment about a stock or market trend.
	•	Bullish (1): Indicates positive sentiment about a stock or market trend.
	•	Neutral (2): Indicates neutral or informational tone.
